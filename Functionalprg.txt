Functional Programming:
                       Functional Programming is a programming paradigm designed to handle fuctions in a better way in js.
                       (mainly pure fuctions).

               JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language.we can ues object oriented,procedural and functional prg paradigms all at the
                same time in js.
          
        Functional programming has a few important concepts that we need to know and understand.By implementing these concepts in our
         application we will be ending up with more of functional code,this will make a huge differencein our application.  

   Key Features of functional programming
1. Imperative and Declarative way of writing code.
2. Pure fuctions.
3.Higher order Functions(map,filter,reduce,etc)
4.composition
5.closure
6.currying
