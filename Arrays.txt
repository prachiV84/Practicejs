Array-
      similar to variable an Array also stores data but it can store multiple data items.

    It enables storing multiple values under same variable name and we can perform operation on them 
    by using different methods and properties also every value gets a sequential index starting from 0.

    In javascript arrays can store values of different data types. whereas in staticaly typed language can store
    only that data by which array is defined.

    Representing an Array:
             aray starts from index 0 by default and it goes upto the last element.  


  Array Methods-
    1.pop():here value is removed from the last index.
     eg:
        arr2.pop()
        console.log(arr2);

    2. push():here value is added at the last index.
        eg:arr2.push(100)
          console.log(`pushed a array`,arr2);
        
    3.shift() :basically works like pop but it will remove the value from first.

         eg: var d=arr2.shift()
           console.log(d);

    4.unshift (): basically works like push(),but it will add element at the start index.

           eg:  var e=arr2.unshift(24)
             console.log(e);
             console.log(arr2);
